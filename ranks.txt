LEADER - (Always existed)
  They lead the entity. This cannot be granted to people

ADVISOR - (Always existed)
  Has access to private chunks. The usefulness of this rank is only backed by player-run activity. In other words, if they are not people who de facto advise the leader, give them a more appropriate rank.

GENERAL - (Always existed)
  Has access to private chunks. The usefulness of this rank is only backed by player-run activity. They should be granted this only if they are going to lead the military in event of a conflict.

SUCCESSOR - (Always existed)
  Has access to private chunks. Will become leader in event the leader abdicates. Note: Disbanding a nation makes all of its states independent. It does not turn a nation into unclaimed free space.

OFFICIAL - (Always existed)
  Has access to private chunks. Appoint this to people who do a good job. This rank is the most ideal rank to give to players you want to grant lordship to, but it is equally ideal to give to anyone you consider a court member.
