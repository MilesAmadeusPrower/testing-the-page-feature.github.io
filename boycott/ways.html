  <h1>How you are able to boycott EarthMC</h1>
  <p>Spreading the word only goes so far. People who have nothing to do with EarthMC wouldn't be able to count unless they are police who are able to arrest known pedophiles that have sufficient evidence piled against them. So, the scope of this boycott could only either spread to the earth server community, or if you are not part of it, partaking would have to require your own first-hand actions.</p>
  <h2>Make your own anti-EarthMC youtube series</h2>
  <p>There's plenty of youtubers who have done series where they cause damage to p2w servers, or documented the scumminess of their owners. Indeed, making a series about EarthMC that has the same format is a perfectly viable option to take. Indeed, many have gone on this route, the earliest among them being the well known youtuber <b>SalC1</b>.</p>
  <h2>Word of Mouth</h2>
  <p>If you know friends in the earth server community, and they are interested in EarthMC, make them know what EarthMC is actually doing before they have to know the hard way. You can even link them to <a href="index.html">this page</a>. If they are not interested in playing EarthMC, but they are still on a server where EarthMC came to them, make them aware of who they are dealing with.</p>
  <h2>Ask your server staff to boycott</h2>
  <p>If you can do anything, there is always starting a #BoycottEMC movement on your local server. Again, if your server is not an earth server, they can't do very much. But, if it is an earth server, then this is a matter that can definitely concern the server staff, and they definitely can coordinate something against EarthMC, whether it be banding between servers, preparing their own servers, or selectively banning EarthMC staff members. This is by no means their only set of options.</p>
  <h2>Disillusion the subscribers</h2>
  <p>EarthMC depends on being able to illusion new subscribers faster than they can disillusion old ones. However, if the word is spread to people who are considering joining EarthMC (preferably not too intrusively), this will reduce the efficiency of their unsustainable advertisement complex even further. It is most important especially that subscribers of youtubers that were recently lied to are made aware, prior to joining, that the server wants their queue priority money, and nothing else.</p>
  <h2>Return EarthMC's cancel culture back to its sender</h2>
  <p>It's long ceased to be a secret that EarthMC uses cancel culture wherever possible, to silence oppositions, and to prevent exposing some ugly truths about them. However, the thing about cancel culture is, it's a cutthroat race to scandalize and ruin as many people as the movement can physically do so. They know very well that it will backfire which is why they fight tooth and nail to outcancel everyone that could be seen as a threat. EarthMC has entire chasms of scandals that could easily turn into a massive vaccuum if disturbed just right.</p>
  <p>People like Nick_cage102, BreachDGates, Magenent, Naptune, AD31, or Tailz8003 can afford to be cancelled over and over again on EarthMC since they have no actual dirt that can be dug up, but if Fix, or KarlOfDuty is cancelled just once, it could mean game over for EarthMC. They've reached out to piles upon piles upon piles of people, all of whom would be concerned, and those same youtubers who gave them money and players, could easily retaliate in a magnitude equally proportionate to the magnitude they had served them.</p>
