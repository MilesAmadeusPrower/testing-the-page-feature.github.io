   <h2>1. The quality of EarthMC is very poor</h2>
   <p>Many people tried and failed to rectify this very problem. The root cause of this problem is that EarthMC does not even care about the quality of their server. They only see numbers of players, and listen only to that. As a matter of fact, they are opposed to any kind of reform because they do not want to have to put in effort to make the server good.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why many attempted reformers of EarthMC have been later turned against in some way or another, whether it may be a ban purge, or utilizing cancel culture.</p>

   <h2>2. The server politics advertized are actually terrible</h2>
   <p>EarthMC advertizes as a geopolitical server, where people get to make a country, and get to interact with the server's other nations. Players are thus falsely lead to believe that if they made a nation, they can also wage wars, and they can forge alliances, or that they can become diplomatic. This cannot be farther from the truth however.</p>
   <p>The server's politics are inherently unchanging, and tightly controlled by the staff, and the staff favour only a select few factions. In other words, they ruined the only one feature they are actually honest about. You might be thinking that's how politics works, of course not everyone gets to win. But consider this - In real life, you don't have presidents, or prime ministers, let alone candidates who do not even have power, randomly disappear from existance, because God decided they do not follow an ideology, or even because they are too neutral.</p>

   <h2>3. The server does not care about lying to its players</h2>
   <p>They have bribed youtubers time and time again into plugging their server, under controlled conditions that make players believe their server is impressive. Youtubers will show big impressive buildings, a short queue, and especially go on about how you can wage wars and make an impressive nation.</p>
   <p>What they always fail to show those players is that the queue is very long. So long that they even have paywalls, just to be able to go maybe 100 players shorter. It is also very likely that most, or even all of the impressive buildings shown by one youtuber were built by people who got scammed by a faction that did not know how to build one themselves. As for wars, there is literally no war system. In fact, in all of the 2 years since they advertized, there never was one.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="aesthetic top" id="p4" hidden>
   <h2>4. Because they can just bribe another youtuber</h2>
   <p>Whenever a playerbase gets disillusioned about what the server is really like, the staff do not care about whether they quit, whether out of protest, or hatred. If one group of youtubers protest, they get another. People who came to EarthMC over a youtube video have the shortest end of the stick in every way possible.</p>
   <p>They have set this precedent ever since ibxtoycat, and have not stopped there. Everytime EarthMC is short on players, and in a crisis, you can absolutely find out, because whenever they do, you'll be seeing yet another youtube video that plugs their terrible excuse of a server.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="aesthetic top" id="p5" hidden>
   <h2>5. They will scam you</h2>
   <p>They maintain a long queue that is at least 400-500 players in size. They intentionally try to keep it as long as possible. This is because their mode of scamming depends on it. Want to shorten your waiting time from as much as 6 hours to maybe 4 hours? Pay EarthMC $10, and if you're lucky, you'll be able to cut in line by 200 players. Want to shorten it anywhere close to where youtubers went? Pay them another $25.</p>
   <p>But, you might be thinking, how is that a scam? They're just giving an option to shorten the queue! Well, the scam doesn't kick in until you either realize it's way worse than you were told, or you get banned. Speaking of getting banned...</p>

   <h2>6. Punishments on EarthMC are arbitrary</h2>
   <p>They do not show it to you, but the rules on EarthMC are very long, and deliberately vague. They're also very inconsistent about enforcing even one of those rules. That is because they do not actually care about their rules, they just want to be able to make a ban look justified whenever they use it, on whoever they want. Whenever a staff is on a power trip, and needs to compensate their insecurity, they will dig very deep to find something that's technically a rule break.</p>
   <p>For example, they banned someone for saying one single word in a message from 6 months before. It was a very trivial word at that, something everybody uses all of the time on that server. They may have actually banned them because you backtalked to them or to their friend, because they don't like something about you, or because they felt like it, but because of the way the rules work, they can find a way to smokescreen power trips as "legitimate".</p>

  <div class="aesthetic top" id="p7" hidden>
   <h2>7. EarthMC harbours some rather questionable people</h2>
   <p>The few factions and parties that have been given immunity by the staff in order to remain unopposed also have some rather questionable histories. For instance, I alone have found out at least 3 of those people are pedophiles. However, I don't think it stops at just 3 people. It is much more likely higher.</p>
   <p>In the case of the 3rd one who was also found to be a pedophile, they were banned the splitsecond the news escalated. The timing of the ban, as well as the fact the pedophile was not only friends with every staff, but tooth and nail protected by them, for an entire 3 years before the news happened, is also very questionable as it's more than likely they only banned him out of damage control.</p>

  <div class="aesthetic top" id="p8" hidden>
   <h2>8. EarthMC is already against the earth server community</h2>
   <p>Of all of the incidents/cases that I know, EarthMC has gotten involved in drama with the following servers:
    <ul>
     <li>WorldMC</li>
     <li>PraxisMC</li>
     <li>Datblock/Datearth</li>
     <li>M.C.P.E. (No, not Minecraft Pocket Edition, the oldest standing earth server called Minecraft Planet Earth)</li>
     <li>Earthcraft</li>
    </ul>
   In all of the above cases, EarthMC has either directly harassed the server, attempted to get it taken down, used cancel culture against them, or done all of the above.
   </p>
   <p>EarthMC does not want to coexist with other servers, and if given the chance, it would wipe all of them from existance, whether it be lawsuits, blackmail, cancel culture, if they have the opportunity to do it, they will absolutely do it. EarthMC does not care if a server sees themselves as a dialect of EarthMC or MCPE, nor if they had the idea entirely on their own volition without knowledge of either one. EarthMC wants a monopoly over earth servers period. <a href="ways.html">How can I go about a boycott of EarthMC?</a></p>
