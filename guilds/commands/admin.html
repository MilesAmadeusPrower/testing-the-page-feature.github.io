<h2>/ga safezone</h2>
<p>Take ownership of the built-in safezone. This is best to use if the server owner prefers a guilds-native spawn. It is advised to use, or combine with a proper spawn plugin</p>
<hr />
<h2>/ga dynmap</h2>
<p>Display claims on dynmap. This is normally done automatically, but can be forcefully done, such as for debug purposes.</p>
<hr />
<h2>/ga claim (nation)</h2>
<p>If a nation needs to claim a chunk by force, this command is here. This can only be done by server admins and owners.</p>
<hr />
<h2>/ga playerdata</h2>

<p>If a player is unable to join a nation, you are able to use this command to put them in the nation by force.</p>
