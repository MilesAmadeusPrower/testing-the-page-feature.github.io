<h2>/chunk perm</h2>
<p>This is your goto tool in order to observe all of the permissions contained in the chunk you are standing on.</p>
<hr />
<h2>/chunk edit</h2>
<p>This is a GUI command editor to be able to change all of the related permissions in the chunk, granted if you have access to it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>/chunk fortify [#]</h2>
<p>Every claimed chunk is considered a fort. But by default, an unfortified chunk has next to no capture HP and is therefore not able to fend off anybody. This command is used when you want to invest cobblestone into higher capture HP to be harder to take over during a war.</p>
<hr />
<h2>/chunk repair</h2>
<p>In event a chunk is either taken over, or sieged, you are able to use this command to rebuild.</p>
