  <h1>Towns</h1>
  <p>Towns are the smallest unit of claiming, with the smallest of claim capacities. They are also the most volatile of guilds objects, being able to get founded under a nation or a state.</p>

  <h2>Claim Capacity</h2>
  <p>The claiming capacity is the pseudo-natural limit in which a town can build its cluster of buildings under its jurisdiction. This limit depends on factors such as the promoted status of the town, and the population within the town <a href="https://github.com/Senre-MC/senre-mc.github.io/issues">(Further features that influence this are yet to be added as of 1.0.0)</a></p>

   <h2>Estates</h2>
   <p>To address for property, towns can allocate players into an estate which does not necessarily have to span an entire chunk. Estates are still yet to be added, but they would be able to put players into certain buildings, or even certain floors of a building.</p>
