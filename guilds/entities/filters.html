  <h1>Command Filters</h1>
  <p>Command filters are consistent across every command that is part of the guilds plugin's engine. Exceptions are the /guilds command itself. Whenever the help screen pops up, or whenever the suggestions tab previews the command, it will show all of the filters in a <code>&lt;filter&gt;</code> syntax.</p>
