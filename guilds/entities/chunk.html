  <h1>Chunk</h1>
  <p>The chunk is a 16x16 square. All modes of claims are divided by this very system. A chunk can be owned by a town, a state, and a nation. Chunks also have fortification levels, which in practice is the hitpoints of the claim during a war. The claim also contains all of the generic permissions and important flags contained within. Permissions include <b>chest</b>, <b>build</b>, <b>blast</b>, <b>door</b>, <b>econ</b>, and <b>redstone</b></p>
  <hr />
  <h1>Forts</h1>
  <p>Every claim can be made into a fort. All claims have a capture HP, and the more fortified the claim, the more capture HP it has, and thus the harder it is to occupy. Once occupied, the fortification of the chunk will be lowered by the damage of occupation. Forts use cobblestone and are fortified (or repaired) by /chunk commands. It is a good idea to strategically station forts where the action is likely to take place, rather than along entire borders, as chunk fortifications will yield higher points if taken over.</p>

  <h1>Permissions</h1>
  <p>
   All of the following permission nodes are listed here:
   <ul>
    <li>Chest - This permission applies to all generic containers, such as chests, furnaces, shulker boxes, barrels, or hoppers. This type of permission could be utilized for privacy, or for creating a useful system where the public can interact in that area.</li>
    <li>Build - This permission covers both building and breaking blocks. The best utilization of this permission would apply to giving people a space to farm, cut down trees, or mine.</li>
    <li>Blast - This permission is exclusively mining-related. This is very dangerous to entrust. <i>private local</i> by default means noone can use TNT anywhere.</li>
    <li>Door - You would use this permission to make doors interactable from anywhere.</li>
    <li>Econ - This is around interaction with villagers and animals. Like chest, econ can be a very dangerous permission if used incorrectly, as it can allow one to kill the animals and villagers, whether out of a rash experience grab, or out of a griefer's desire.</li>
    <li>Redstone - This permission applies to redstone-related interactions. Plates, buttons, levers.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
   The permission settings are multi-dimensional. The first section is like so:<br />
   When a permission is <b>private</b>, this means you only entrust this to the entity's ranked players. When a permission is <b>public</b>, you entrust this to everyone within that given entity.<br />
   When the scope is local, this applies only to your immediate property. If you're in a town, the scope is the town. If you're in a state, the scope is the state, and the towns it is part of.<br />
   When the scope is liege, this applies to your immediate property, and the property's owner. If you're in a town, the scope is the town, and their owner, whether it be a nation or a state.<br />
   <span style="color:#999;"><i>When the scope is allies, this applies to your property, its owner, and its friends</i></span><br />
   When the scope is global, this applies to the entire server. Note: <i>private global means all leaders and ranked officials. That'll make for quite an interesting take on a worldwide embassy.</i></p>

  <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
  <p>Chunks in the guilds plugin are part of a "map" that spans 16 by 16 chunks. During the beta phases, several feature ideas were played around with, such as making it possible to label a claim as a lake, a forest, grassland, or farmland. An inactive feature that exists in the code but is not used is one where you can give one of 16 different types of labels, including an arena, house, palace, library, or fort.</p>
