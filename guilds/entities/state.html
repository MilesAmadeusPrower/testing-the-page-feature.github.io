  <h1>States</h1>
  <p>States are divisions of a nation that are delegated to a local ruler. They are the country's provinces, districts, states, or prefectures. A state is useful for keeping a nation organized, decentralized, or even to just give every player who desires their own land, a piece of land. It is a very versatile system</p>

  <h2>Fun facts:</h2>
  <p>A state is able to function as a nation within a nation. In fact, in event a nation is disbanded, all of the states it was in remain, fully independent. This is currently the only way to create an independent state.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Claim Capacity</h2>
  <p>While states are not able to colonize new territory, they are able to integrate nation territory that has been recently colonized. Due to the nature of how states work, they don't have a true limit of claims, but they do still saturate the nation whenever they expand, or shrink. As well, states that take up more than 40% of the total nation are considered too powerful and thus are a significantly higher maintenance to upkeep. <a href="https://github.com/Senre-MC/senre-mc.github.io/issues">(This feature is not yet complete)</a></p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Interactions with players</h2>
  <p>Players cannot apply to join a state, but a state can still send invites to players. A state is also able to create a long list of successors to their lordship, and then an abdication <a href="https://github.com/Senre-MC/senre-mc.github.io/issues">(or inactivity crisis)</a> can result in appointing one of the successors as the new lord.</p>
