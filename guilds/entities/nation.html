  <h1>Nations</h1>
  <p>Nations are the largest unit of claiming, as well as the main type of claim. They are also the most complex of guilds objects.</p>

  <h2 id="aon">Areas of Note</h2>
  <p>As nation claims are much more numerous than most claim plugins, nations are unable to make a claim that snakes for longer than 2 chunks. If you get an error about claiming while you are building an outline, this is why. If you need to claim a longer corridor, it will need to be at minimum 2 chunks thick, or more.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="mnd">Mandate</h2>
  <p>Mandate is a nation's power. It is named this way because while nations are empowered by it, nations are also manda<b>ted</b> to maintain that power. Mandate is gained mainly by activity while mandate is lost mainly by maintenance. Every 72 minecraft days, the long-term mandate gains and losses are tallied.</p>
  <p>The maintenance cost of a chunk lowers or raises depending on how close a chunk is to the nation's centre of control. States are able to mitigate this cost.</p>
  <p>The ideal counter-weight to land maintenance is activity. The more active your players (or the more players you have that get on the server every once in a while), the more mandate you will gain.</p>
  <p>Many aspects of exerting nation power spends mandate, and are most of the time spent immediately. The least expensive of the cost is claiming territory as well as integrating the new territory into a local state or an adjacent city. The most expensive (and potentially most damaging) of the costs are sacking players who have a status in your nation.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="hld">Holdings</h2>
  <p>A nation needs holdings in order to organize its territory, make it maintainable, and localize everything.</p>
  <p><a href="state.html">States</a> are used in order to delegate pieces of territory to a local leader. You are only able to grant states to players that have been ranked. Whenever you use a state instead of your direct territory, the maintenance of that territory is lowered. A state is able to govern itself under a smaller government that works differently from nations. For this reason, it is possible (<a href="https://github.com/Senre-MC/senre-mc.github.io/issues">but not yet implemented</a>) for a state to be made independent.</p>
  <p><a href="town.html">Towns</a> are used whenever builds are made. Because there's a build capacity, it's best to make big cities in places with more players in it, and rural outposts in places with few people in it.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="rec">Recruiting</h2>
  <p>The nation is the only entity that can invite players, <b>and</b> get applications from players. To invite a player, you need to add them to your nation. To accept an application from a player, you also need to add them to your nation.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="rnk">Ranks</h2>
  <p>Whenever you have someone who is doing a good job, it is best to rank them <a href="/ranks.txt">[See ranks here]</a>. It may be important to have both a successor and a regent in your nation for in event you wish to stop ruling, or in event you need to stop ruling for a certain period of time.</p>
